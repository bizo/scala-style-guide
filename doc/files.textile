h2. The Standard Case

Files should contain a single logical compilation unit, meaning a class, trait or object. One exception to this
guideline is for classes or traits which have companion objects. Companion objects should be grouped with their
corresponding class or trait in the same file.

{% highlight scala %} 
package com.bizo.file

class BizoFile { ... }

object BizoFile { ... } 
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Other Exceptions

Other than the case of companion objects, there are two other exceptions to this rule.

First, multiple compilation units should be placed in the same file if this is *required* by the Scala language. One
common example is that of a sealed trait and several sub-classes or sub-objects.

{% highlight scala %} 
package com.bizo.teams

sealed trait BizoTeam

case object AppsTeam extends BizoTeam 
case object DataTeam extends BizoTeam 
case object InfrastructureTeam extends BizoTeam 

case class AdHocTeam(name: String) extends BizoTeam 
{% endhighlight %}

Second, multiple compilation units should be placed in the same file is when multiple classes logically form a single,
cohesive group, sharing concepts to the point where maintenance is served by containing them within a single file.
These situations are harder to predict than the aforementioned sealed supertype exception.  Generally speaking, if it is
easier to perform long-term maintenance and development on several units in a single file rather than spread across
multiple, then such an organizational strategy should be preferred for these classes.  However, keep in mind that when
multiple units are contained within a single file, it is often more difficult to find specific units when it comes time
to make changes.

h2. Naming Conventions

The goal of a filename is to both give an indication of what is inside the file and assist a developer in knowing where
to look for the units contained in that file.  If the name does not assist in understanding what is in the file, the
developer should either pick a more explanatory name or split the contents into multiple files.

Single-unit files and files containing only a trait/class and its companion should obey the Java naming convention.
i.e., the file containing the BizoFile class (and companion object) should be named BizoFile.scala.

Multiple-unit files should be given camelCase names with a lower-case first letter.  This convention differentiates
multi- from single-unit files, greatly easing the process of finding declarations.  If the file contains a single
obvious type that is more significant than the others (e.g. a root type like the BizoTeam trait for the example above),
the file should be named after that type (e.g. bizoTeam.scala).  If there is no dominant type in the file, filenames
should be descriptive of the logical property shared by all units within (e.g. ast.scala).

Not being able to think of a good name is a good code smell for having unrelated concepts in a single file!

In all cases, files should be placed in the directory corresponding to the package of the primary type(s) that they
contain.  e.g., the bizoTeam.scala file should be placed in com/bizo/teams.

In short, in the general case, the Java file naming and positioning conventions should be preferred, despite the fact
that Scala allows for greater flexibility in this regard.  Only place multiple compilation units in a single file if it
is required by the language or if the types are so logically interconnected that having them in multiple files greatly
increases maintainability.

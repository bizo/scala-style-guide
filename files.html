        <p>Types should be organized to promote long-term maintenance and development.  For single-unit files (including the case<br />
of a class/trait and its companion), Java naming and placement conventions should be preferred, despite Scala allowing<br />
for greater flexibility in this regard.  Developers may optionally choose to use multi-unit files when required by the<br />
language or when placing the types in a single file promotes maintainability.</p>
<h2>Single-Unit files.</h2>
<p>Generally, &#8220;single-unit&#8221; files include those containing a single top-level definition, meaning an un-nested class, trait<br />
or object.  Additionally, this section also applies to classes or traits that have companion objects.  Companion objects<br />
should be grouped with their corresponding class or trait in the same file.</p>
<p>Using single-unit files is always allowed as a default organizational choice.</p>
</notextile>

h2. Multi-Unit files.

Other than the case of companion objects, there are two cases where developers may choose to place multiple units in a
single file.

First, multiple compilation units should be placed in the same file if this is *required* by the Scala language. One
common example is that of a sealed trait and several sub-classes or sub-objects.

<notextile><p>Second, multiple compilation units should be placed in the same file when multiple classes logically form a single,<br />
cohesive group, sharing concepts to the point where maintenance is served by containing them within a single file.<br />
These situations are harder to predict than the aforementioned sealed supertype exception.  Generally speaking, if it is<br />
easier to perform long-term maintenance and development on several units in a single file rather than spread across<br />
multiple, then such an organizational strategy should be preferred for these classes.  However, keep in mind that when<br />
multiple units are contained within a single file, it is often more difficult to find specific units when it comes time<br />
to make changes.</p>
<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>
<p>The goal of a filename is to both give an indication of what is inside the file and assist a developer in knowing where<br />
to look for the units contained in that file.  If the name does not assist in understanding what is in the file, the<br />
developer should either pick a more explanatory name or split the contents into multiple files.</p>
<p>Single-unit files (including those containing only a trait/class and its companion) should obey the Java naming convention.<br />
i.e., the file containing the BizoFile class (and companion object) should be named BizoFile.scala.</p>
<p>Multiple-unit files should be given camelCase names with a lower-case first letter.  This convention differentiates<br />
multi-unit from single-unit files, greatly easing the process of finding declarations.  If the file contains a single<br />
obvious type that is more significant than the others (e.g. a root type like the BizoTeam trait for the example above),<br />
the file should be named after that type (e.g. bizoTeam.scala).  If there is no dominant type in the file, filenames<br />
should be descriptive of the logical property shared by all units within (e.g. ast.scala).</p>
<p>Files whose dominant (or only) type is the package object should be named &#8220;package.scala&#8221;.</p>
<p>Not being able to think of a good filename is a strong indication that the file contains unrelated concepts!</p>
<p>In all cases, files should be placed in the directory corresponding to the package of the primary type(s) that they<br />
contain.  e.g., the bizoTeam.scala file should be placed in com/bizo/teams.  As packages should also group related<br />
classes together, we expect that most files will contain only types living under this primary package.</p>
